# Streamlit-Data-Viz-Project

### Completed as part of the coursera guided project

The dashboard allows analysis of data related to motor vehicle incident statistics in New York City.

This is a basic data visualisation dashboard, built in Python using streamlit. The dashboard is intended to be interactive such that it is easy and intuitive to use. The data set is included in the repo. 


### Usage:

`` pip install streamlit ``

`` streamlit run app.py ``


### What I learnt:

* How to use streamlit to build a data visualisation dashboard
* How to query data using pandas
* How to build an interactive web app
